# Quiz Challenge
This is the host app I used to run the quiz module.  The quiz module has no external dependencies, and should run in any Angular2 app made with the angular-cli.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.1.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
